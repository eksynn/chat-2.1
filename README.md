# Plugin issues

Decided to fork and make my own modifications to chat 2, since anna doesn't listen to requests

-♡-

all it'll do is, ontop of chat 2 features:
• it'll add a button to toggle the focus from pressing enter to go to either chat 2.1 or to the original ui
• if i ever figure out how to, i'll also add a button to copy the settings from the original UI to c2.1

don't expect great things, nor for me to keep this updated
